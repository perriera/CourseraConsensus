IMPORTANT: 
- Manually keep the changelog version number in sync with CMakeLists.txt project version.<br>
- Keep the changelog.md up to date, neat and tidy, (as it is a convenient tool for code maintenance).<br>
- Use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) such that<br>
- Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:<br>
- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,<br>
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and<br>
- PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes. <br>
- But there is no need to change the version number for correcting spelling errors, (etc).<br>
- MAKE SURE to tag and update the tag compare list below, (for quick code comparison purposes).<br>
